    <p><b><i>Hobbits, also known as Halflings, were a mortal race of Middle-earth. Though their exact origins are unclear, <br> they were initially found in the northern regions of Middle-earth and below the Vales of Anduin. <br> At the beginning of  the Third Age, hobbits moved north and west. Most of their race eventually settled the land of the Shire, founded in <br> the year TA 1601, though some among the Stoors remained in the Anduin Vale.</i></b> </p>
