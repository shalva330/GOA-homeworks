<p>Lion prides can be as small as 3 or as big as 40 animals. In a pride, lions hunt prey, raise cubs, and defend their territory together. In prides the females do most of the hunting and cub rearing. Usually all the <br> lionesses in the pride are relatedâ€”mothers, daughters, grandmothers, and sisters.</p>
