<p><u>The Komodo dragon is a huge venomous lizard. Theyre the largest lizards <br> on the planet and theyre also one of the oldest, too. They are well known for their venomous bite. <br> The Komodo dragon will force venom into the bloodstream of its  <br> prey using its serrated teeth, which will then weaken the prey and prevent them  <br>from walking away. Their saliva also contains a lot of bacteria which exposes the <br> bite wounds to infection.</u></p>
