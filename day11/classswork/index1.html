<p><u>Chimpanzees are great apes found across central and West Africa. Along <br> with bonobos, they are our closest living relatives, <br> sharing 98.7 percent of our genetic blueprint. Humans <br> and chimps are also thought to share a common ancestor who <br> lived some seven to 13 million years ago.</u></p>

<h1>Vervet Monkeys</h1>

</center>

<p><u>The vervet is a small, black-faced monkey, common in East Africa.<br> There are several subspecies of vervet monkeys, but, generally, the body is a greenish-olive or <br> silvery-gray. The face, ears, hands, feet, and the tip <br> of the tail are black, but a conspicuous white band on <br> the forehead blends in with the short whiskers. </u></p>
